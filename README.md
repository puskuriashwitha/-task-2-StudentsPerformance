# -task-2-StudentsPerformance.
About this Task:
Hey! This task was all about exploring the Students Performance dataset and trying to understand it better using some stats and cool visuals.

 What I did in this task:
1 Imported the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset using Pandas.

2 Checked the number of rows, columns, and data types to get a feel of the data.

3 Looked for missing values in the dataset (there weren’t any).

4 Checked value counts for all categorical columns to see how many students were in each category.

5 Got summary statistics like mean, median, min, max, std for all score columns.

6 Created histograms for Math_Score, Reading_Score, and Writing_Score to see their distribution.

7 Plotted boxplots for the score columns to check for outliers.

8 Drew a correlation heatmap to find which scores are related to each other.

9 Used a pairplot to visually check how these scores are connected.

10 Noticed some interesting patterns — like students who scored high in one subject usually did well in others too.
